# Steps for setting up this project from scratch:

1. `ember new ember-skeleton` - create a new ember project (`cd
   ember-skeleton` once done so you're in the created directory)

2. Edit bower.json and package.json. Change the version for ember and
   ember-data to "^2.0.0". Then do `npm install` and `bower install`

3. `ember install ember-simple-auth` (You may need to do `bower install`
   afterward.)
